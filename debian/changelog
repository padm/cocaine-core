cocaine-core (0.10.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.5.
  * ZeroMQ has gone completely.
  * Cocaine is no longer standalone. Multiple nodes can be linked together to
    form a cloud, at last. When an app requests a service which is not local,
    a request is made to resolve the specified service remotely.
  * Apps are now exposed as services by default. If a specific application
    should not be published, set the 'local' flag in the manifest.
  * Named queues. Drivers can now enqueue their sessions to a specific worker
    with some human-readable name. The sessions in named queues will be pumped
    before any anonymous sessions in the engine's shared queue.
  * A pair of new profile options: crashlog-limit and log-output. The first
    one limits the number of lines of captured stdout and stderr of a dead
    to save, the second one enables the copying of the output to the log.
  * The Locator can now be bound to a configurable port, allowing users to get
    multiple Runtimes on a single host.
  * Engines will now display the reason for app stop in the log.
  * Bugfix: engines will now try to rebalance when the last slave dies and
    there're still sessions in the queue.
  * Bugfix: unblock all signals before slave execve(), allowing slaves to be
    killed with SIGTERM on termination.

  * Storage API v2. The list() method was superseded by the find() method,
    which supports tags and indexing. New blobs can be tagged via a new
    parameter to write().
  * Bugfix: if a slave decide to die (because of an unrecoverable error, for
    example), then detach every session assigned to it before death.
